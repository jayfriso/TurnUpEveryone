# TurnUpEveryone
for nwhacks2016

This is the project we made for nwHacks2016. 

The core idea behind this project is providing a community playlist that sustains itself through a night-long party.
We used firebase and the spotify api.

THe current status of this project is very messy. There is still the issue that only my login information with spotify will work.
I will see what I can do with this project and possibly clean up the code and make it more stable.

Also if the spotify api gets better with their web player, I may move this project to a more stable web framework like Play.
